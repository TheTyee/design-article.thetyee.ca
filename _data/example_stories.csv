,"Gov't Released Thousands of Records on Health Firings? Not Quite, Says Dix","With many records unrelated, officials' claims are 'deeply misleading,' says NDP MLA.",http://thetyee.ca/News/2009/10/09/adrian-dix.jpg,NDP MLA Adrian Dix says that many pages released by the government are unrelated to the 2012 firings.,andrew Macleod,,,,,,"<p>Senior British Columbia government officials have said that thousands of pages of records have been publicly released on the botched 2012 firings by the Health Ministry, but an opposition critic says the claim is false.
</p>
<p>""A fair person reviewing these 2,000 pages would say that's not a true statement [that they relate to the firings],"" said Adrian Dix, the MLA for Vancouver-Kingsway. ""In fact, those statements were deeply misleading.""
</p><p>
Amrik Virk, the minister of technology, innovation and citizens' services, first made the claim on Nov. 3 that thousands of pages on the firings are available. Under pressure in the legislature about the firings, he said, ""The members opposite suggest that government produced no records, but in fact some 40 packages containing 4,500 pages have been released under FOI to the requester.""
</p><p>
Much of that information is already available on the website where the province posts the responses to freedom of information requests, he said. ""Of this -- there are 28 packages -- some 2,000 pages were actually posted online in open information.""
</p><p>
And in a Nov. 23 memo to all Health Ministry staff passing on a request from ombudsperson Jay Chalke that they not delete any records related to the firings while Chalke is investigating the matter, deputy health minister Stephen Brown wrote, ""The ministry has produced a large number of records respecting the terminations in response to freedom of information requests and during Marcia McNeil's [earlier] investigation.""
</p><h3>

 
Unrelated records
</h3><p>
A Health Ministry spokesperson provided a spreadsheet listing the 28 packages Virk referred to in the legislature, sending it both to The Tyee and an NDP researcher who independently made the same request.
</p><p>
Dix said the list included many pages of documents unrelated to the firings.
</p><p>
For example, it included a report on the Families First Agenda engagement process, a summary of focus groups from the Seniors' Healthy Living Secretariat, and a discussion guide on a 10-year plan to address mental health and substance use in the province.
<p>
There was also a memo to deputy ministers about the launch of the premier's innovation and excellence awards, a report from the Michael Smith Health Research Foundation on maximizing the impact of health research, and a briefing note about a private member's bill on concussions.
</p><p>
While Dix said many of the records appeared to be added to the list at random in an attempt to support Virk's statement in the legislature, it also included 32 pages in response to a request for ""All documents regarding LifeSciences BC's interest in and proposals around accessing health data held by PharmaNet."" LifeSciences BC is an association of biotechnology industry companies.
</p><p>
""They're making a link that's an interesting link, it seems to me,"" Dix said, observing that government officials had previously said there was no connection between the industry and the firings. The link was almost certainly made unintentionally, he said.
</p><p>
Dix said it's clear many of the pages that Virk said were already released to the public about the firings were totally unrelated.
</p><h3>
Undocumented decisions
</h3><p>
In September 2012, the Health Ministry announced allegations related to data management, contracts and conflicts of interest that would lead to seven firings and the freezing of several drug research contracts. Work that stopped as a result included plans for an assessment of Premier Christy Clark's pet anti-smoking program.
</p><p>
The government has since reinstated two of the people who were fired, settled out of court in three wrongful dismissal and defamation lawsuits, and Clark has apologized for some of the firings and for misleading the public. Two lawsuits are ongoing.
</p><p>
A review by lawyer Marcia McNeil of what went wrong with the firings was released in December 2014, but McNeil wrote that she could not answer the basic questions of who made the decision to fire the workers or why.
</p><p>
McNeil wrote in her findings that throughout her investigation no employee would acknowledge their own role in any decision-making, resulting in a lot of finger pointing. Her investigation was also stymied by a ""dearth of documents,"" such as reports, briefing notes, and meeting notes, which she noted are ""frequently prepared in situations where discipline may be contemplated.""
</p><p>
Dix said neither McNeil nor the public have seen records about the actual decision to fire people. ""They released records of people who were in middle management and researchers, but there are no records for the decision makers,"" he said.
</p><p>
He noted that Brown himself conducted a months-long review that ended most of the lawsuits and reinstated two of the people who'd been fired, but that in doing so he produced no records. ""That, I have to tell you, is impossible,"" Dix said.
</p><p>
Nor did other senior officials including Premier Clark, former health minister Michael de Jong, deputy to the premier John Dyble and deputy minister Athana Mentzelopoulos have records related to the firings, Dix said.
</P><p>
Decision makers have taken advantage of a lack of records to dodge responsibility, he added.
</p><p>
""These are Christy Clark's rules,"" Dix said. ""These are the rules set down by the premier and her most senior people.”</p>"

Why Are So Many Dying Unnoticed in BC Supportive Housing?",Lindsey Longe's sad death in 2012 wasn't an isolated case.,http://thetyee.ca/Opinion/2015/11/29/LindseyLongeWithMom_610px.jpg,"Lindsey Longe with mother Christine Harris. Lindsey died on July 16, 2012. Photo submitted by Christine Harris.",Tom Sandborn,,,,,,"On July 16, 2012, Lindsey Longe died alone in a squalid Vancouver room littered with the evidence of his battles with addiction, poor health and hoarding. He was 30.

Days before, he had checked out of a hospital and returned to his tiny one-room apartment. It's unclear if anyone noticed that Longe failed to emerge from his room after that.

After he died, Longe's body lay amid the clutter for three more days before he was found.

If this happened in one of Vancouver's notorious single-room occupancy slum hotels, it might be just another sad but unsurprising story.

But Longe wasn't in a flophouse. He was living in Pacific Coast Apartments, a 96-unit government-funded complex on West Pender Street that promises staff support for residents to keep them safe, even ""individualized support plans.""

And his sad death wasn't an isolated case.


 
More than 25 per cent of the deaths in provincially funded supportive housing in Vancouver weren't reported for at least two days, according to a BC Coroners Service report obtained through a freedom of information request. The information covered the period from Jan. 1, 2010 to July 20, 2015.

Longe's mother, Christine Harris, doesn't believe that anyone checked on her son as he lay dying. For more than three years, she has been fighting to find out why he was forgotten -- for the final days of his illness and the three days his body lay in the room. She fears that he spent his last four days alive alone and in pain.

No one from Coast Mental Health, the non-profit that operates Pacific Coast Apartments, called her to tell her that Lindsey was dead, she said.

""I had to learn my son had died from a posting on Facebook by one of his friends, and I still haven't gotten answers about why he died alone after days of pain,"" she said. ""I know his friend Rob, who posted about Lindsey's death, had been worried and asked staff to check on him the day before he died.""

Harris said she was relieved when Lindsey moved into the apartments shortly after they opened in 2012 and was assured staff would check on him every day.

That's certainly the kind of support the politicians seemed to promise at the gala opening for the apartment. The federal and provincial governments paid for the project and the City of Vancouver contributed land.

Rich Coleman, the provincial minister responsible for housing, said residents would be ""connected with supports and specialized services to help them stay safe and create better opportunities."" It was the fourth of 14 similar supported living residences the province was creating, he said.

James Moore, then a Conservative MP, said the apartments would provide people with ""a safe, supportive place to live, as well as the help they need to begin a new chapter in their lives.""

And Coast Mental Health executive director Darrell Burnham also talked about the importance of supports. The agency's website says it currently operates more than 30 housing sites in Vancouver, Burnaby and Surrey, where ""trained and accredited Coast Community Mental Health Workers provide support to residents.""

With such supports, how did Longe's death go unnoticed for three days? He must have also suffered the days before he died -- where were the supports then?

Not isolated

According to the BC Coroners Service document, Longe's unheeded death was not an isolated incident. It reveals that in the last five years 82 deaths were reported in 30 supportive housing facilities funded by BC Housing in Vancouver.

In at least 22 cases, the deaths weren't reported for two days or more after the person had died. Six of these 22 deaths were reported after a delay of three days and one after a four-day delay. In two of the 22 cases, the death reports came to the coroner after a five-day delay.

(The number of deaths not reported within two days could be even higher. The document reports the maximum delay for a reported death at each of the 30 residences. In some cases, more than one death could plausibly have gone unreported for two days or more at the site in question. The Coroners Service did not reply to a Tyee request for clarification before publication.)

BC Housing helped fund supportive housing for 18,839 people in 2013. It says the program is designed to meet the needs of vulnerable people -- the homeless, frail seniors, people with disabilities, Aboriginal individuals and families, and women and children at risk of violence.

But if residents' deaths can go unreported for days, where are the supports? How are staff checking on residents' safety or well-being?

Harris has been unable to get answers to questions about her son's last days. She knows Longe checked himself out of St. Paul's Hospital, and that he died as a result of infective endocarditis, an inflammation of his heart tissues, and resulting staphylococcal sepsis, a massive infection.

But she can get no information about what happened to him when he returned to the apartment, what checks were made and how his death went unnoticed.

When Harris saw the Facebook post and learned her son was dead, she called Pacific Coast Apartments. ""The staff member I spoke with refused to answer my questions, citing Lindsey's privacy,"" Harris told The Tyee. ""Most of my questions remain unanswered now over three years later.""

""It is unbearable to lose my child, but to try to get answers afterwards has been excruciating,"" Harris said. ""Instead of being able to grieve Lindsey's death, I have been forced to spend countless hours trying to get answers.""

The little information she has received has just raised more questions. Harris said she was shown (but not allowed to copy) a document that purported to record a staff member checking on Lindsey the day he died and reporting he was OK. Harris believes the claim must be false, but has had no success in getting answers.

Little comfort

Harris says she has pressed Coast Mental Health's Burnham and former board chair Dr. Peter Gibson for copies of policies and procedures for workers at Pacific Coast Apartments. They have told her polices have been improved since her son's death, Harris said, but haven't provided any evidence that would presumably detail those improvements.

Burnham didn't provide copies of current procedures and those in place in 2012 to The Tyee. Nor did he respond to an email asking for comment on allegations by Harris that staff were unco-operative and hostile after her son's death and that they cleared his room and sent most of his possessions to the landfill.

Burnham did say supervision of residents had been improved since Longe's death. ""We've been trying to tighten it up. Supervision is much better now than it was in 2012.""

""The biggest issue here,"" he said, ""is that we are governed by the Residential Tenancy Act. We're not allowed to enter residences except in the case of an emergency.""

But the act allows ""entry necessary to protect life or property."" Surely getting no response from a sick, vulnerable person living in a tiny apartment qualifies as an emergency.

Burnham said it's important to focus on supportive housing's successes. ""It is easy to look at the deaths, but it is hard to know how many lives have been saved and seen dramatic improvements,"" he said. ""We do know that with stabilized supportive housing, resident health improves.""

BC Housing also refused to comment on its policies about how often residents in supportive housing should be checked.

A communications staffer, who asked not to be named, responded with an email statement that provided no real answers.

""BC Housing's non-profit partners that operate supportive housing facilities conduct regular room/wellness checks. The frequency of these room checks is determined by the non-profit operators. Building operators must balance safety concerns with requirements of the Residential Tenancy Act, specifically a person's right to privacy in their own home, which is something many tenants are concerned about.""

Not much comfort to Harris, who is still wondering about the last days of Lindsey's life. And still waiting, after more than three years, to hear whether a coroners' inquest will be held into her son's death.

The evasions and non-answers should not be acceptable to taxpayers who fund these supportive housing facilities. Harris deserves a full response to her questions and an apology for the delays and insults she suffered after her tragic loss.

The province should commission an independent inquiry into why so many residents in its supportive housing have been allowed to die alone and rot in their rooms. Ugly language, I know, but we seem to be dealing with an ugly pattern of inadequate service by BC Housing and some contractors.

It is time to do a better job of housing fragile and vulnerable people in B.C."

Instead, his business, Picnix -- which just wrapped up a successful season delivering six-course, on-demand picnic meals to customers in English Bay and Stanley Park -- went in a different direction, one of a small (but growing) number of local companies expanding beyond a traditional brick-and-mortar operation in favour of taking their ventures online.

""There's an increasing number of businesses going online, particularly in the grocery category, as well as books and entertainment,"" notes Amy Robinson, founder of local business alliance LOCO BC. ""Businesses have to learn to capture that online spending. Because going forward, it's going to represent such a huge portion of retail sales.""

Today marks the biggest online shopping day of the year and the beginning of Buy Local Week -- presenting both challenge and opportunity to small business across the country. From one-of-a-kind thrift shops displaying finds on Instagram to the local experiences delivered by companies like Picnix, Robinson maintains innovative digital paths abound.

""It doesn't have to cost a lot of money,"" she says. ""There are a lot of options if you want to get started, without having to pay developers and service providers.""

Mom-and-pop dot com?

When it comes to online presence, local ventures like Picnix are still something of an anomaly in Canada. Generally speaking, a recent Vancity study found 61 per cent of Canadian businesses have no online presence whatsoever. And this oversight is proving costly. In 2015, B.C.'s brick-and-mortar operations are set to lose an estimated $1.6 billion to online sales -- much of that to major American companies with no local infrastructure at all.

At the same time, online sales in Canada are expected to increase by more than 50 per cent over the next five years, with British Columbians -- the country's most prolific online shoppers -- set to lead the charge.

""It's a good time to start developing a digital presence if you don't have one,"" notes Christine Bergeron, Vancity's VP of community business. Though brick-and-mortar stores and online retail can seem like vastly different business models, Bergeron explains that the two worlds are surprisingly intertwined. ""A lot of people go online to do research, and then go into stores to buy something. Or, they go into a store to look around, and then purchase online,"" she explains. ""For businesses to be able to blend the two is something that's really important right now.""

Digital edge: Vancouver-based Picnix sells a locally-sourced culinary experience online.

According to a recent study conducted by LOCO BC, 69 per cent of consumers cited Canadian ownership as the most important attribute they look for in a shopping experience, with close to 50 per cent preferring to buy from a business within their home province. Yet, currently, $2 of every $3 spent online goes to a U.S. website. And with online sales numbers projected to double by 2019, the need for local businesses to develop a robust digital presence is quickly transforming from a matter of convenience to one of survival.

""Almost all of the businesses we surveyed are spending less than $100 a year on advertising,"" notes LOCO's Robinson. ""And that's definitely got to change. Offline, most local businesses are depending on word-of-mouth. But online, it's a different world: paying for Google AdWords, and Facebook posts.

""Consumers we surveyed are saying that they value local business. They want to buy local. They're definitely looking for local. They're just not finding it online.""

Increasing local bandwidth

Where small-scale businesses once shunned the web, next-generation startups are making the internet local. Rather than attempting to compete with global giants like Amazon, local entrepreneurs like Simon have responded by getting creative, building on-demand, digital businesses that don't merely sell goods -- they sell an experience.

There's Your Pinata, an online venture which creates custom pinatas from photographs. There's Leather Monsters, which builds individualized children's toys from a workspace in Parker Street Studios. There's Naked Snacks, which delivers healthy, local snack food directly to your door.

For its part, the Picnix experience is about as hyper-local as it gets; all the food is sustainable and locally-sourced. The custom wagons (which fold out into tables) were designed and built in a shop on the Downtown Eastside, with help from Portland Hotel Society's Craig Sinclair. Pearson-Roach's mother (a local cheesemaker) provides the cheese, and his sister Elyse bakes the cheesecake desserts.


 
""All of this has been done on the cheap,"" he notes. ""I did all the finishing, and did all the branding, and the final touches and painting and all that in the rec room of my apartment. It's been a hell of a challenge.""

For Pearson-Roach, the strategy appears to be working. Not only did Picnix pay off its loans in its first season, but it's even slated for an expansion, which will include hand-held baskets, more meal options, and a new commissary space on Denman and Davie. Response from customers and the public has also been overwhelmingly positive. In fact, he explains, that response quickly became a marketing tool in its own right.

""People were really curious when they saw the units out around English Bay,"" he recalls. ""'What is this? Where did you get that?' I don't think people have seen anything like them before.""

If it all goes well, there's talk of further expansion; storefront locations, franchise agreements, and pop-up shops further down the West Coast. Despite the challenges to come (he still expects to pull double shifts during the 2016 season, working days at Picnix, and nights as a server at Vancouver's Forage restaurant), Simon is one of a growing number of business owners challenging global problems with local solutions. And as digital competition continues to change the marketplace, other local businesses are slowly beginning to follow suit, finding creative ways to thrive.

""Just like if you owned a small business, and suddenly a big-box store moved in down the street, you'd have to rethink what your offering was,"" muses Bergeron. ""If you want to keep the storefront, it's going to be a matter of having a compelling reason for people to come into your store. Or, it might go beyond the products, and be about whatever other competitive aspects you can bring in.""

The permutations are virtually endless: some, like Archimallows, have opted for a multichannel approach, featuring events, online sales, and short-term pop-up shops throughout the year. Others ply their trade exclusively offline, at farmers markets, or festivals like Portobello West. Still others enter into creative business partnerships, combining retail with wholesale, sharing shop space with other businesses, or selling their wares in communal storefronts like the Window Community Art Shop.

""It's about trying to reinvent with a new variable in play,"" Bergeron concludes. ""And it's a variable that's not going away."
