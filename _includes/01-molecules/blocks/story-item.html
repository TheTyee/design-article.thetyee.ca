<!-- The story-item object is a list-item (although it doesn't need to appear in a list) that consists of the meta-info about an article. It's intended for use in places like the Latest Stories organism and the Related Story molecule.

HOW TO INCLUDE THIS ASIDE OBJECT
---------------------------------
Use the content-source parameter parameter to specify the path of its contained image. Like this: 
	[% include 01-molecules/blocks/story-item.html content-source="http://baconmockup.com/300/200" %]

If you want to adapt the object you can extend it by using the story-item-class parameter to add a new BEM class. Like this:
	[% include 01-molecules/blocks/story-item.html content-source="http://baconmockup.com/300/200" story-item-class="story-item--latest-stories" %]
-->
