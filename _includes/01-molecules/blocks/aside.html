<!-- The aside object is a block for content that is tangentially related to the content that forms the main textual flow. It can contain any of the media atoms or any other objects that are appropriate aside contents (https://www.w3.org/TR/html-markup/aside.html), in particular: media objects, related stories, and possibly Tyee messaging (like asks).
All media within an article body should be included from within either a figure object or an aside object.

The aside object will appear as an inset box on narrower viewports and in the right margin of the page on wider viewports.

By default asides are not displayed in views narrower than 500px. Use the :has pseudo-class to display asides that contain essential story content.


HOW TO INCLUDE THIS ASIDE OBJECT
---------------------------------
Use the aside-contents parameter to specify the path of its contained object. Like this: 
	[% include 01-molecules/blocks/aside.html aside-contents="01-molecules/blocks/related-story" %]

You can also specify a caption string, media credit and a content-source parameter if the contained object requires it. Like this:
	[% include 01-molecules/blocks/aside.html aside-contents="01-molecules/blocks/related-story" aside-caption="Caption text goes here" media-credit="Photo by Hoffman" content-source="http://baconmockup.com/300/200" %]

If the aside contains a related-story object then you must set the parameter related-story-title. This will get passed on to the related-story object. For example:
    [% include 01-molecules/blocks/aside.html aside-contents="01-molecules/blocks/related-story" related-story-title="A Tyee Kinder Morgan Reader" content-source="/ui/img/KinderMorgExpansion_600px.jpg" %]

If the aside contains a fact-box then you must set a fact-box__content parameter and a fact-box__title parameter (if your fact-box needs a title). fact-box__content should be written in html (e.g. text should be within <p> tags), but all quote marks must be escaped like this: \" otherwise Jeckyll won't compile properly.

Sometimes the content of an aside is too big or too long to float next to paragraph text in narrow viewports and is intended to display below the article (as in the case of a fact-box). In this case the aside should receive the class "hide-on-narrow-vp", like this:
	[% include 01-molecules/blocks/aside.html aside-contents="01-molecules/blocks/fact-box" aside-class="hide-on-narrow-vp" %]
