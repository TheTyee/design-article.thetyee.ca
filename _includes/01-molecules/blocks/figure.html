<!-- The figure object is a block for supporting content that is directly related to the main textual flow. It can contain any of the media atoms or any other objects that are appropriate figure contents ( https://www.w3.org/wiki/HTML/Elements/figure ). It will also typically contain a caption describing its content.
All media within an article body should be included from within either a figure object or an aside object.

The figure object will appear within the main content flow on all viewports.  

Modify this object with .figure--XL to produce an extra-wide object that breaks out of the text column in larger viewports.

HOW TO INCLUDE THIS FIGURE OBJECT
---------------------------------
Use the figure-contents parameter to specify the path of its contained media object molecule. Like this: 
	[% include 01-molecules/blocks/figure.html figure-contents="00-atoms/images/image" %]

You can also specify a caption string, media credit and a content-source parameter if the media object molecule requires it. Like this:
	[% include 01-molecules/blocks/figure.html figure-contents="00-atoms/images/image" figure-caption="Caption text goes here" media-credit="Photo by Hoffman" content-source="http://baconmockup.com/300/200" %]

To make the figure extra-large (breaking out of the text column in wide viewports) add the class "figure--xl". This can be done by setting the figure-class paramter like this:
	[% include 01-molecules/blocks/figure.html figure-class="figure--xl" %]
