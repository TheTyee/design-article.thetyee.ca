<!-- The fact appears at the bottom of the article by default, but appears in the sidebar in wider viewports. This is done by changing the value of the fact-box's display property based on location/context and viewport width (by targeting .fact-box via css). 
    The additional .hide-on-narrow-vp class gets applied to the containing 
    <aside> so that its margin doesn't cut into the the text column when
    the fact box is hidden. (This ugly class could probably be eliminated if 
    asides were simply a class rather than a container, or if an aside's 
    margins were applied to it's contents instead of the container itself.)

    In default (narrow) viewports there should be the option of putting an anchor text-link within the article body text so that readers can easily get down the page to the fact-box. E.g:
	    <a href="#fact-box-1" class="fact-box__anchor-link">Inline link to fact box.</a>
    ... as seen in the atom fact-box-anchor-link.html which can be embedded into the paragraph.html atom.
    This link will be set to display:none in wider viewports. 
    There is empty <span id="fact-box-1"></span> at the bottom of the article__body to serve as the destination anchor for this link. (Assign #fact-box-1 to the fact-box object itself wouldn't work because the html for this object appears in 2 locations on the page.)
