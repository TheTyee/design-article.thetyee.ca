<!-- The figure object is a block that can contain any of the media atoms. All media within an article body should be called from within a figure object. Use the figure-contents parameter to specify the path of contained molecule. Like this: [% include figure.html aside-contents="01-molecules/blocks/related-story" %]

Modify this object with .figure--XL to produce an extra-wide object that breaks out of the text column in larger viewports.
