        <p><strong>Tyee Presents is the special section within The Tyee where we highlight contests, events, and other initiatives on behalf of select partners.</strong></p>

        <p>We choose our partners carefully and consciously, to fit with The Tyee’s reputation as B.C.’s leading home for news, culture, and solutions. Whether it’s a contest for music festival tickets, a weekend getaway, an announcement of a public dialogue or fundraising event, they’re things we believe will be of interest to a wide variety of our readers, and resonant with their values.</p>

        <p>Content within Tyee Presents plays an important part in growing revenue for our independent, professional, paid journalism. Advertising relationships, media sponsorships, and other types of business partnerships support us financially and help to grow our readership.</p>

                <h2>Frequently asked questions:</h2>
                <p class="m-t-3"><strong>Does The Tyee offer sponsored content services?</strong></p>
                <p>The Tyee only offers editorial coverage in the Tyee Presents section if the event or organization fits all of the following criteria:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>Is a good fit with our educated, engaged, and progressive readers’ interests and values.</li>
                        <li>Allows our readers to participate in some way: contests, public dialogue or speaker events, and crowdsourcing initiatives are often good fits.</li>
                        <li>Financially supports our independent, professional, paid journalism, and/or offers significant media sponsor opportunities to grow our readership</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If your organization, event, or product is not a fit for Tyee Presents, we’re still more than happy to offer regular standard banner advertising.</p>
                <p>Please contact Jeanette Ageson, our chief revenue officer, to discuss opportunities (604-689-7489 / <a href="mailto:jageson@thetyee.ca">jageson@thetyee.ca</a>.</p>

                <p class="m-t-3"><strong>My event / organization / initiative is newsworthy, but we don’t have a budget for advertising and promotion. How do I contact the newsroom?</strong></p>
                <p>If you think your event, organization, or initiative will interest our news team, please contact them separately with your inquiry <a href="mailto:editor@thetyee.ca">here</a>.</p>

                <p class="m-t-3"><strong>Does The Tyee have an events listings page?</strong></p>
                <p>Sorry, no. Useful, curated, well-organized and searchable events listings are a major undertaking, and The Tyee does not currently have the resources to manage it.</p>
