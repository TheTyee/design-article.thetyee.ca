        <p><strong>Tyee Presents is the special section within The Tyee where we highlight contests, events, and other initiatives on behalf of select partners.</strong></p>

        <p>We choose our partners carefully and consciously, to fit with The Tyee’s reputation as B.C.’s leading home for news, culture, and solutions. Whether it’s a contest for music festival tickets, a weekend getaway, an announcement of a public dialogue or fundraising event, they’re things we believe will be of interest to a wide variety of our readers, and resonant with their values.</p>

        <p>Content within Tyee Presents plays an important part in growing revenue for our independent, professional, paid journalism. Advertising relationships, media sponsorships, and other types of business partnerships support us financially and help to grow our readership.</p>
