		<!-- Put the story list in here.
		Start from bootstrapâ€™s default Media Object (if possible) ( http://getbootstrap.com/components/#media ) and then applying my atomic conventions.
		This object should default to its mobile-first stacked state and only become horizontal at higher breakpoints (see mockups for the 2 states). In mobile stacked state it should be limited to 3 items. In horizontal state it should show enough items to fill the viewport width, ideally with slider functionality to reveal more items.
		-->
		LATEST STORIES go here. This will be the full-width component showing the Latest Stories. Stacked by default, horizontal in wider viewports.
