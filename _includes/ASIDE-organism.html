<aside>
Similar to the figure object, this aside object is a block that can contain any of the media atoms. It can also contain a Related Story molecule or *maybe* an Ask molecule.

Use the figure-contents parameter to specify the path of contained molecule. Like this: [% include figure.html aside-contents="01-molecules/blocks/related-story" %]
