        <p>Condon is correct that the the city doesn't budget as if housing was truly a top priority. So it's time for a rethink. Housing is literally foundational to organizing ourselves. Without it, our lives fall apart.</p>
        <p>At the same time, money isn't all that City Hall has in their toolbox to increase supply. The zoning incentives Condon lists here seem highly affordable.</p>
        <p>If current approaches are driving up land prices, I'd like City Hall to plan community engagement to generate more practical ideas and initiatives for affordable housing. The more heads on this one, the better.</p>
