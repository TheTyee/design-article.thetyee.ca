  than directly <link>'ed in the header. <link>'ed CSS files are very slow to edit
  with Chrome's devtools due to some kind of resource mapping bug. @import'ing
  the CSS file seems to avoid the bug (or maybe prevent resource mapping).
  Another thing to note is that the @import'ed stylesheet shouldn't itself contain
  any @import declarations, otherwise you end up with yet another devtools bug
  shitstorm and a headache the size of mother russia. */
