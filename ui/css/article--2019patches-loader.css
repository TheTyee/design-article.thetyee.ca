/* NOTE: For jekyll dev purposes the main css code should be @import'ed rather
than directly <link>'ed in the header. <link>'ed CSS files are very slow to edit
with Chrome's devtools due to some kind of resource mapping bug. @import'ing
the CSS file seems to avoid the bug (or maybe prevent resource mapping).
Another thing to note is that the @import'ed stylesheet shouldn't itself contain
any @import declarations, otherwise you end up with yet another devtools bug
shitstorm and a headache the size of mother russia. */
