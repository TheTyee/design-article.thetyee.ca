/* NOTE: For jekyll dev purposes the main css code should be @import'ed rather
than directly <link>'ed in the header. <link>'ed CSS files are very slow to edit
with Chrome's devtools due to some kind of resource mapping bug. @import'ing
the CSS file seems to avoid the bug (or maybe prevent resource mapping) */
